# codechef-hackathon

This project was built for [Codechef API hackathon](https://www.codechef.com/CAH1801/)

Our app allows its user to use codechef on your phone. Using this app you can see ongoing contests, future contests, contest problems, practice problems, read problem statements and you solve the problems in the IDE inside the app. You can also set reminders for upcoming contests. Download the code from IDE to make submissions on codechef. This will help users to use codechef whenever they want to be it while travelling on bus/metro etc or during a boring lecture.

This repo has two folders `android-app` has the code for the android app and `php-backend` having code for the middleware api server b/w the android app and the codechef api server.
